Lecture notes from a statistics course I teach at Potsdam

This is a graduate level course for linguistics students at Potsdam. It introduces frequentist statistics from the ground up, without using too much mathematics.

A pdf is provided: Freq_CogSci.pdf

For the github repo for the above notes, which will eventually become a book, please see:
